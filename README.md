"We strongly encourage students to form study groups, and discuss the lecture videos (including in-video questions). We also encourage you to get together with friends to watch the videos together as a group.
However, the answers that you submit for the review questions should be your own work. For the programming exercises, you are welcome to discuss them with other students, discuss specific algorithms, properties of algorithms, etc.;
we ask only that you not look at any source code written by a different student, nor show your solution code to other students."

# Review

After completing the Machine learning course by Stanford University.
This course gave an in-depth explanation of machine learning and its possible application in various industries.
Special Thanks for Andrew Ng who did an excellent job in explaning everything in a well-structured manner.
